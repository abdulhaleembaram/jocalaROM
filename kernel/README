This project is a Gingerbread kernel and related files for the Samsung Epic 4G. 

Its parts are:

1. Samsung's release of GB source for the Epic 4G
2. initramfs from rodderik@xda
3. Kernel patches from mkasick@xda

The patches I have applied are:

fix_ce147_product.diff
loose_vermagic.diff
reboot_bml8_recovery.diff

decomp_cachebufram.diff
decomp_copy_atags.diff
kexec_fixes.diff

relocate_pmstats.diff

keypad_delays.diff
keypad_delays_initrc.diff
remove_ts_printks.diff

Props to rodderik & mkasick! I hope to further update
this kernel as time, interest and comprehension allow.
